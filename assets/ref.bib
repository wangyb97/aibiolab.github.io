  abstract = {RNA-binding proteins play crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression, and understanding the interactions between RNAs and RBPs in distinct cellular conditions forms the basis for comprehending the underlying RNA function. However, current computational methods pose challenges to the cross-prediction of RNA-protein binding events across diverse cell lines and tissue contexts. Here, we develop HDRNet, an end-to-end deep learning-based framework to precisely predict dynamic RBP binding events under diverse cellular conditions. Our results demonstrate that HDRNet can accurately and efficiently identify binding sites, particularly for dynamic prediction, outperforming other state-of-the-art models on 261 linear RNA datasets from both eCLIP and CLIP-seq, supplemented with additional tissue data. Moreover, we conduct motif and interpretation analyses to provide fresh insights into the pathological mechanisms underlying RNA-RBP interactions from various perspectives. Our functional genomic analysis further explores the gene-human disease associations, uncovering previously uncharacterized observations for a broad range of genetic disorders.},

  abstract = {The single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) quantifies the gene expression of individual cells, while the bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA‐seq) characterizes the mixed transcriptome of cells. The inference of drug sensitivities for individual cells can provide new insights to understand the mechanism of anti‐cancer response heterogeneity and drug resistance at the cellular resolution. However, pharmacogenomic information related to their corresponding scRNA‐Seq is often limited. Therefore, a transfer learning model is proposed to infer the drug sensitivities at single‐cell level. This framework learns bulk transcriptome profiles and pharmacogenomics information from population cell lines in a large public dataset and transfers the knowledge to infer drug efficacy of individual cells. The results suggest that it is suitable to learn knowledge from pre‐clinical cell lines to infer pre‐existing cell subpopulations with different drug sensitivities prior to drug exposure. In addition, the model offers a new perspective on drug combinations. It is observed that drug‐resistant subpopulation can be sensitive to other drugs (e.g., a subset of JHU006 is Vorinostat‐resistant while Gefitinib‐sensitive); such finding corroborates the previously reported drug combination (Gefitinib + Vorinostat) strategy in several cancer types. The identified drug sensitivity biomarkers reveal insights into the tumor heterogeneity and treatment at cellular resolution.}

However, scHi-C experiments generate inherently sparse data, which poses a challenge for loop calling methods. The existing approach performs significance tests across the imputed dense contact maps, leading to substantial computational overhead and loss of information at the single-cell level. To overcome this limitation, a lightweight framework called scGSLoop is proposed, which sets a new paradigm for scHi-C loop calling by adapting the training and inferencing strategies of graph-based deep learning to leverage the sequence features and 1D positional information of genomic loci. With this framework, sparsity is no longer a challenge, but rather an advantage that the model leverages to achieve unprecedented computational efficiency. Compared to existing methods, scGSLoop makes more accurate predictions and is able to identify more loops that have the potential to play regulatory roles in genome functioning. Moreover, scGSLoop preserves single-cell information by identifying a distinct group of loops for each individual cell, which not only enables an understanding of the variability of chromatin looping states between cells, but also allows scGSLoop to be extended for the investigation of multi-connected hubs and their underlying mechanisms.}

  abstract={Motivation
    Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an increasingly popular technique for transcriptomic analysis of gene expression at the single-cell level. Cell-type clustering is the first crucial task in the analysis of scRNA-seq data that facilitates accurate identification of cell types and the study of the characteristics of their transcripts. Recently, several computational models based on a deep autoencoder and the ensemble clustering have been developed to analyze scRNA-seq data. However, current deep autoencoders are not sufficient to learn the latent representations of scRNA-seq data, and obtaining consensus partitions from these feature representations remains under-explored.

    Results
    To address this challenge, we propose a single-cell deep clustering model via a dual denoising autoencoder with bipartite graph ensemble clustering called scBGEDA, to identify specific cell populations in single-cell transcriptome profiles. First, a single-cell dual denoising autoencoder network is proposed to project the data into a compressed low-dimensional space and that can learn feature representation via explicit modeling of synergistic optimization of the zero-inflated negative binomial reconstruction loss and denoising reconstruction loss. Then, a bipartite graph ensemble clustering algorithm is designed to exploit the relationships between cells and the learned latent embedded space by means of a graph-based consensus function. Multiple comparison experiments were conducted on 20 scRNA-seq datasets from different sequencing platforms using a variety of clustering metrics. The experimental results indicated that scBGEDA outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on these datasets, and also demonstrated its scalability to large-scale scRNA-seq datasets. Moreover, scBGEDA was able to identify cell-type specific marker genes and provide functional genomic analysis by quantifying the influence of genes on cell clusters, bringing new insights into identifying cell types and characterizing the scRNA-seq data from different perspectives.

  abstract={Motivation
Recent frameworks based on deep learning have been developed to identify cancer subtypes from high-throughput gene expression profiles. Unfortunately, the performance of deep learning is highly dependent on its neural network architectures which are often hand-crafted with expertise in deep neural networks, meanwhile, the optimization and adjustment of the network are usually costly and time consuming.

Results
To address such limitations, we proposed a fully automated deep neural architecture search model for diagnosing consensus molecular subtypes from gene expression data (DNAS). The proposed model uses ant colony algorithm, one of the heuristic swarm intelligence algorithms, to search and optimize neural network architecture, and it can automatically find the optimal deep learning model architecture for cancer diagnosis in its search space. We validated DNAS on eight colorectal cancer datasets, achieving the average accuracy of 95.48%, the average specificity of 98.07%, and the average sensitivity of 96.24%, respectively. Without the loss of generality, we investigated the general applicability of DNAS further on other cancer types from different platforms including lung cancer and breast cancer, and DNAS achieved an area under the curve of 95% and 96%, respectively. In addition, we conducted gene ontology enrichment and pathological analysis to reveal interesting insights into cancer subtype identification and characterization across multiple cancer types.

  abstract={Motivation
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can provide insight into gene expression patterns at the resolution of individual cells, which offers new opportunities to study the behavior of different cell types. However, it is often plagued by dropout events, a phenomenon where the expression value of a gene tends to be measured as zero in the expression matrix due to various technical defects.

Results
In this article, we argue that borrowing gene and cell information across column and row subspaces directly results in suboptimal solutions due to the noise contamination in imputing dropout values. Thus, to impute more precisely the dropout events in scRNA-seq data, we develop a regularization for leveraging that imperfect prior information to estimate the true underlying prior subspace and then embed it in a typical low-rank matrix completion-based framework, named scWMC. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on simulated and real scRNA-seq data. Extensive data analysis, including simulated analysis, cell clustering, differential expression analysis, functional genomic analysis, cell trajectory inference and scalability analysis, demonstrate that our method produces improved imputation results compared to competing methods that benefits subsequent downstream analysis.

    abstract = {Thanks to the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, massive amounts of various biomolecular data have been accumulated to revolutionize the study of genomics and molecular biology. One of the main challenges in analyzing this biomolecular data is to cluster their subtypes into subpopulations to facilitate subsequent downstream analysis. Recently, many clustering methods have been developed to address the biomolecular data. However, the computational methods often suffer from many limitations such as high dimensionality, data heterogeneity and noise.In our study, we develop a novel Graph-based Multiple Hierarchical Consensus Clustering (GMHCC) method with an unsupervised graph-based feature ranking (FR) and a graph-based linking method to explore the multiple hierarchical information of the underlying partitions of the consensus clustering for multiple types of biomolecular data. Indeed, we first propose to use a graph-based unsupervised FR model to measure each feature by building a graph over pairwise features and then providing each feature with a rank. Subsequently, to maintain the diversity and robustness of basic partitions (BPs), we propose multiple diverse feature subsets to generate several BPs and then explore the hierarchical structures of the multiple BPs by refining the global consensus function. Finally, we develop a new graph-based linking method, which explicitly considers the relationships between clusters to generate the final partition. Experiments on multiple types of biomolecular data including 35 cancer gene expression datasets and eight single-cell RNA-seq datasets validate the effectiveness of our method over several state-of-the-art consensus clustering approaches. Furthermore, differential gene analysis, gene ontology enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis are conducted, providing novel insights into cell developmental lineages and characterization mechanisms.The source code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/yifuLu/GMHCC.

    abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are a group of proteins associated with RNA regulation and metabolism, and play an essential role in mediating the maturation, transport, localization and translation of RNA. Recently, Genome-wide RNA-binding event detection methods have been developed to predict RBPs. Unfortunately, the existing computational methods usually suffer some limitations, such as high-dimensionality, data sparsity and low model performance.Deep convolution neural network has a useful advantage for solving high-dimensional and sparse data. To improve further the performance of deep convolution neural network, we propose evolutionary deep convolutional neural network (EDCNN) to identify protein–RNA interactions by synergizing evolutionary optimization with gradient descent to enhance deep conventional neural network. In particular, EDCNN combines evolutionary algorithms and different gradient descent models in a complementary algorithm, where the gradient descent and evolution steps can alternately optimize the RNA-binding event search. To validate the performance of EDCNN, an experiment is conducted on two large-scale CLIP-seq datasets, and results reveal that EDCNN provides superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, time complexity analysis, parameter analysis and motif analysis are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm from several perspectives.The EDCNN algorithm is available at GitHub: https://github.com/yaweiwang1232/EDCNN.

    abstract = {In recent years, single-cell RNA sequencing enables us to discover cell types or even subtypes. Its increasing availability provides opportunities to identify cell populations from single-cell RNA-seq data. Computational methods have been employed to reveal the gene expression variations among multiple cell populations. Unfortunately, the existing ones can suffer from realistic restrictions such as experimental noises, numerical instability, high dimensionality and computational scalability.We propose an evolutionary multiobjective ensemble pruning algorithm (EMEP) that addresses those realistic restrictions. Our EMEP algorithm first applies the unsupervised dimensionality reduction to project data from the original high dimensions to low-dimensional subspaces; basic clustering algorithms are applied in those new subspaces to generate different clustering results to form cluster ensembles. However, most of those cluster ensembles are unnecessarily bulky with the expense of extra time costs and memory consumption. To overcome that problem, EMEP is designed to dynamically select the suitable clustering results from the ensembles. Moreover, to guide the multiobjective ensemble evolution, three cluster validity indices including the overall cluster deviation, the within-cluster compactness and the number of basic partition clusters are formulated as the objective functions to unleash its cell type discovery performance using evolutionary multiobjective optimization. We applied EMEP to 55 simulated datasets and seven real single-cell RNA-seq datasets, including six single-cell RNA-seq dataset and one large-scale dataset with 3005 cells and 4412 genes. Two case studies are also conducted to reveal mechanistic insights into the biological relevance of EMEP. We found that EMEP can achieve superior performance over the other clustering algorithms, demonstrating that EMEP can identify cell populations clearly.EMEP is written in Matlab and available at https://github.com/lixt314/EMEPSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
